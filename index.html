Development for po-util ended in May 2020 and it is no longer maintained.

In the summer of 2020, neopo, a Python replacement for po-util was created
with the goals of better compatibilty with official Particle tools,
portability, maintainablilty, and ease of use.

Please use neopo for all future local Particle development needs:

If you are looking for support please use the Particle forum
or open an issue in the neopo repository on GitHub:
